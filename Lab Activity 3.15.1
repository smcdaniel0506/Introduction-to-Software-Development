/*
   (1) Use scnr.nextLine(); to get a line of user input into a string. Output that line. 

   Ex:

   Enter text: IDK how that happened. TTYL. 
   You entered: IDK how that happened. TTYL.

   (2) Expand common text message abbreviations. Output a message for each abbreviation that is expanded, 
   then output the expanded line. Note: Check for abbreviations in the order provided below. 

   Support these abbreviations (you only need to support these):

   BFF -- best friend forever
   IDK -- I don't know
   JK -- just kidding
   TMI -- too much information
   TTYL -- talk to you later 
   Ex:

   Enter text: IDK how that happened. TTYL. 
   You entered: IDK how that happened. TTYL.

   Replaced "IDK" with "I don't know".
   Replaced "TTYL" with "talk to you later".

   Expanded: I don't know how that happened. talk to you later.
